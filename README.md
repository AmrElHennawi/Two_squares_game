# Two Squares Game

This is a console-based implementation of the Two Squares Game. The game allows two players to take turns selecting two squares on a 4x4 board. The goal is to choose two adjacent squares, and when successful, those squares are removed from the board. The player who removes the last pair of squares wins.
